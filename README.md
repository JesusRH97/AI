# AI projects

This repository contains two projects which use artificial intelligence tools. Of course, feel free of modifying whatever you want.

The first one is the tic-tac-toe game which is based on the Minimax algorithm (you can look it up in the internet). Since tic-tac-toe is not the most difficult game in the world, I have played against the computer with no success, so if you beat the computer playing with this algorithm, let me know it!

The second one is a CNN that uses the dataset of clothes from Keras. Try it and you will realize it is quite accurate at predicting the images.
